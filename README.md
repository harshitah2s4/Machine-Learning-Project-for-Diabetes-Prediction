# Machine-Learning-Project-for-Diabetes-Prediction
Building a system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning. This project is done in Python. In this project I have used Support Vector Machine model for the prediction.

***Steps Followed-***

**Importing the required Dependencies-** Importing all the required libraries for our model.

**Data Collection and Analysis-** Load the PIMA Diabetes Dataset and analyse it

**Separating the features and data-** Label 0 will correspond to Non-Diabetic. Label 1 with correspond to Diabetic.

**Data Standarization-** Standarizing the data in a particular range

**Split the data into Training data & Testing-** For 80% of data  is stored in X_train and corresponding labels Y_train. Similarly 20% of data is stored in X_test and corresponding labels in Y_test.

 **Data Model Evaluation-** Accuracy score of the training data :  0.7866449511400652.
Accuracy score of the test data :  0.7727272727272727.

**Building a Predictive System-** This is the last step.This gives the result whether a person has diabetes or not.
